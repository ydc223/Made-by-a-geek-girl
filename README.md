# A [website](http://paidgrade.info) developed by Yana Chala, CS student at NYUAD

It cointains a blog about technological biases and the influence of software on people's lives. 
In addition it hosts the projects that I have worked on for the past semester:
1) [What does a scientist look like?](http://paidgrade.info/project.html) - is a project that highlights the excistance of a stereotypical image of a scientist. It tries to convey that there is more to scientist than a man with a funky looking hair.
2) [MoreThan140] (http://paidgrade.info/moreThan140/map/public/index.html) - is a project that aims to move the conversation from twitter to an environment that does not restrict you to a 140 characters. It collects the tweets about the most relevant news on different topics from UN News and visualizes collected tweets on a world map and encourages users to discuss the issue. 
3) [PaidGrade](http://paidgrade.info/paidGrade/public/index.html) -  is an initiative that attempts to fight corruption in Ukraine in the field of education. The goal of the project is to colect information about the bribes that were paid in different universities across Ukraine and make the information publicly available. The next step is to visualize the data on a map to demonstrate the level of corruption in universities and to raise awarness about the possible ways of fighting it.
