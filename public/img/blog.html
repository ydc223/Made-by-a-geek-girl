                <h1>A leverage point in the educational system in Ukraine</h1>
                <p>In this response, I will analyze the problem of corruption in the higher educational institutions in Ukraine, based on the concepts described in the “Leverage Points Places to Intervene in a System” by Donella Meadows. In my opinion, the higher education in Ukraine is corrupt for several reasons: the professors are not paid enough, students are not motivated to learn from the courses, and finally, there is a lack of feedback in the system. 
                </p>
                <p>I found it particularly interesting to think of corruption in the educational system as of a positive feedback loop described as the seventh most effective way to intervene in the system in the paper. Corruption is a positive feedback loop. The more bribes are paid, more corrupt the system is, and therefore, more bribes are paid. The systems had already destroyed itself by prioritizing profits over the quality of education. It is conceptual that lowering down the bribe rates would be the leverage point in the system. Flipping the loop around where reporting corruption would reinforce less corruption in the institutions is the obvious solution but finding a correct leverage point for it is not obvious.
                </p>
                <p>I scale my analysis of the problem to the range of feasible solutions that I can propose. While I believe that the system has leverage points beyond the ones described here, I want to focus on the power of information flows (#6 in the paper). I believe that the educational system in Ukraine is lacking feedback in multiple ways. Firstly, despite the fact that everyone is aware of corruption no one is considering reporting it. For example, my friend was forced to pay a bribe but she never considered raising against it. Is it because she did not know whether reporting it would make a difference or just harm her future in the school. Or is it because she never thought of doing so since it has never been a norm. Secondly, there is no feedback about the professors within the universities. Collecting and displaying this feedback could play a significant role in the process of evaluating the effectiveness of the system. Making students and faculty question whether the system is effective is a leverage point. In addition, showing that corruption in the higher educational institutions around the world is not a norm is significant when deciding whether to report a bribe or not.

                <h1>Guilty pleasure of being informed.</h1>
                <p>Can you think of a moment when you lied to someone? Did you feel guilty or satisfied afterwards? Now, can you think of a moment when you bluffed, whether in the game, or the real life. For some reason, successful bluffing fulfils me with a feeling of guilty pleasure, giving me a fake sense of smartness and success. There is this strange value to the ability to predict people’s behaviors and reactions, and to be able to use it for your own purposes.
                </p>
                <p>Considering all the research that facebook is currently working on to analyze all the data that people have put in, my first thought is that facebook is able to study human behaviours and use this knowledge for various things. In the case of facebook, the guilty pleasure that I described in the previous paragraph, is substituted by accountable profits that the company is able to make from predicting people’s behaviors. Facebook claims that their main goal is to “support the well-being of the people who provide Facebook with their data, using it to make the service smarter” (p. 15). But is that their ultimate goal?
                </p>
                <p>Considering the power that facebook has when it comes to testing social behaviors hypotheses and actually studying how humans interact in the social networks, facebook has the ultimate power to manipulate people. The users can endlessly analyze and criticize social networks, but they will keep using them and keep staying trapped in a cobweb, designed by clever engineers. It seems that facebook is harmless to you at first sight, just a platform to share your news and interact with people, but there are thousands of people, working on it every moment - designing smarter feed algorithms,  analyzing your data and “improving” your experience.

                <h1>How effective is a political side of social media?</h1>
                <p>Strong social media presence in the lives of modern youth provides them with a powerful tool for expressing opinions regarding various political situations. Social media acts as an intermediary between a huge number of people and their “active” political involvement that requires minimal efforts to get involved. Yet, in my opinion, it is a successful way to start a collective political movement within a country. The article Taking power through technology in the Arab Spring by Ramesh Srinivasan describes the importance of social media during the Arab Spring. Not only the public used it to share genuine opinions, the interested parties used it even more actively to make their presence noticeable, their propaganda common and their ideas communal.
                </p>
                <p>Similarly, social media played an important role at the protests that happened more recently during Euromaidan in Ukraine (2013-2014). The actual power of social media seems to take place in two situations: 1) when it is able to connect people in the real world; 2) when it is able to strongly popularize a certain idea among the public. When former Ukrainian President decided to reject a pending EU association agreement, social media went crazy about the issue. It served as a main hub for people to express discontent and as a platform to plan actual demonstrations. Students would go online and see that their friends are planning to go to the central square at certain time; they share and join. At the same time social media served as the most effective method of advertisement at that period. Political figures, musicians, and others would join the demonstrations, document it and push it online to for it to be spread in the endless routes of social media.  In fact, to measure the effectiveness of social media in the context of a specific political situation, millions of posts, pictures and videos have to be processed and analyzed. Nevertheless, the fact that governments are trying to sensor collective action on social media, proves that it is effective at influencing people’s political views.

                <h1>Privacy?</h1>
                <p>A debate on topic whether or not NSA has a right to scan people’s private information is more complex issue than just a matter of human rights written in the US constitution. It goes beyond the borders of a certain country; it is international and it is personal ant the same time. As stated in the article, the operations like this exist to be secret, but the rights have to be written in the law. Yes, it is not written that the government has access to the private information. However, does it really matter for me if the program scans my emails, searching for the key words and after a useless attempt moves on to the next innocent person?</p>
                <p>I was surprised to know that the majority of the public do not care that much about preventing terrorist attacks when it is done through getting into their private zones of information. That leads me to another question, where does the privacy even start?  After moving to the digital age, humans were able to store reliably trillions of units of information but the whole problem with computers, with Internet, is that is public. People try to make it private and secure, but it is a constant battle between black hats and white hats. Make the program secure, find a leak, make more secure, and find another leak…. and so on. So if Internet is not secure any way would not it better to be able to use it as a tool to secure real world?
                </p>
                <p>        On the other hand, the bureaucracy that surrounds the system does not make it appealing for us to trust. I can totally understand that people want their space and their communications be private if they were meant to be so. In addition, I think in any case the final word should belong to public. If majority believes it is not okay for the information to be processed then it should not be processed. Regardless, I think it is wrong for the government to be breaking the limits of privacy that people believe they deserve.

                <h1>What if we had to play video games at school?</h1>
                <p> Coming from a standpoint that video games are used for entertainment and as a rule appear to be a waste of time, I found the Rhetoric of Video Games to be innovative for me. The article made me realize that, indeed, video games can be an effective form of communicating a message or a way of educating the “players”. Having had an experience of a camp leader in the English summer camp, where the main goal is to teach the kids participative leadership and promote community involvement I realized that games play a huge role in this process of children education. Therefore, if games is such an effective way of educating children in an interactive and fun manner, then why not to consider video games, designed for the similar purposes? Playing with children helps to keep them more engaged in a topic, therefore, teaching them to play certain video games may have even stronger effect since the world, represented in the game can highlight real issues and keep children engaged at the same time.</p>

                <p> I found it interesting that Ian Bogost proposes a new term for describing video games’ persuasive power – procedural rhetoric, since not rhetoric, nor visual rhetoric are able to capture the way of how video games use the embedded model to simulate certain aspects of human experiences. Furthermore, I believe that the correct use of certain video games in educational purposes can be more effective than reading or writing about a certain issue. By imitating some process the developers of the video games are able to create a set of rules for players to go through a certain ideology, certain issue and deeper relate to it, feel the emotional pressure. However, development of games requires a certain skillset of technological knowledge, and while the papers can be written by anyone, only people of certain background can develop the video games. This makes the idea of using video games as educational medium distant from approvement by the majority. </p>

                <h1>"Human Bias vs Machine Bias"</h1>
                <p>        While a lot of activists trying to fight biases in gender and race in the society, they do not realize that software can be biased as well. A user of a search engine, when searching for a certain query expects to get the most relevant results. It is not a secret that there are millions of pages out there that the machine has to process to display relevant results for the query. Usually, the user is satisfied by a quality of the results and does not question whether they represent a full picture. User is likely to assume that due to some magic, provided by engineers employed at various search engines, user gets the most objective and accurate results. However, the performed magic is not always as accurate and unbiased as it might seem. Man is to Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker and Machine Bias are two excellent examples, which prove that software can be biased. Furthermore, these biases, taken as a completely objective information, can play a significant role in someone’s lives, whether it is being given a longer prison sentence due to the score, influenced by a skin color, or being ranked lower at the search related to computer science just due to the gender.
                <p>        I find it interesting that the origins of the biases are coming with different intensions. In the article Machine Bias, it seems that race, nationality and skin color (or at least one of them) are explicitly taken into account during the generation of the score. It means that the bias appears as the part of the algorithm. While in Man is to Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker it seems that gender bias comes as the side effect. In other words, when the algorithm for word embedding was designed it did not mean to take into account gender or race explicitly. In the article, word embeddings were trained on Google News and the bias occurs as the result of the word use throughout the training data. The machine-learning algorithm in this case is not trying to be racist or sexist; it just happens to represent to some extent “true picture”. It represents that female underrepresentation in computer science exists in the real world and tries to represent the same world as the result. So, is the debasing attempt happens to be a sort of cheating, when trying to capture the real world or is it a protest attempt against the gender inequality?

                <h1>"The Nature of Software"</h1>
                <p>        The constant technological development in computer science is fascinating. I think the question “Why, after a half century of study and practice, is it still so difficult to produce computer software on time and under budget?” (p. 9) is not taking into account the improvement of software-production power overtime. Yes, indeed, it is still difficult to develop computer software. However, without any progression in the field, how much time and resources would it take to write Windows XP (40 million lines with the modern tools (p. 10)) back in 1970s when the Object Oriented Programming still did not exist? If to take into account the progression in the programmers’ producing power due to the constant innovations, “software makers” are doing the incredible job with their productivity. Although it takes a lot of time and effort to develop a computer software, the speed of the development in the field is progressing exponentially. The programming languages becoming smarter and more intuitive, this makes software development faster, easier and more “people-friendly”. At the same time, it is hard to keep up with the progress. This is a never-ending learning cycle.</p>
                <p>        The author argues that successful projects in software development happen as the exception rather than the rule. On the other hand, it is hard to think of the field where everything goes as planned. If to think of the number of countries in the world that are badly off, the number of failed startups, the amount of music pieces by Beethoven that have never gained popularity, the percentage of scientific researches that do not end up with the desirable discovery, the number of artworks that do not get to the exhibition’s stage, it would not be a big discovery to see big numbers in each of those examples. It is a rule that most of the projects driven by originality, creativity and group collaboration do not end up being successful and there is nothing surprising in the small success rate in software development. It is probably true that unsuccessful software development waists one of the largest amounts of money but the successful “exceptions” prove to be worth it.</p>

                <h1>"Electronic Civil Disobedience"</h1>
                <p>I have never thought of Computer Science power through the lens of its possible influence on politics.
                    NYUAD, as well as numerous hackathons proved how effective "hacker’s" solutions could be when it comes to health, education, infrastructure and other social problems but I have never associated this with politics. In fact, those solutions are mostly political. </p>
                <p>The algorithm for coming up with the new technological innovation is identifying the problem that people confront in their lives, coming up with a solution, building it and, voilà, you have just transformed an already established aspect of someone’s life. In a way, this is mirroring the desired effects of Electronic Civil Disobedience, where certain individuals come together with professionals of different areas and target a “political” problem that they believe is creating inefficiency in their society.</p>
                <p>The idea of a cell, the small but motivated activist organization, described in the text seems to be an effective model of the political resistance. However, on the large scale, are small groups like this would be able to change much? It is hard to answer the question of this kind without practically trying it but the analogy of EDC with the tech startups of the past several decades, shows that those groups may have a big influence on the political issues. Numerous technology that are nowadays transforming the world had started as initiatives of small groups of people. However, this analogy is imperfect because startup world has a huge monetary motivation while the aforementioned cells should be driven mostly by people’s true incentives rather than by money.</p>
                <p>Whether or not Electronic Civil Disobedience is an effective form of political resistance it is definitely its future. It is just the matter of right people, passionate about similar issues but having different skills, coming together and transforming the established powers.</p>
